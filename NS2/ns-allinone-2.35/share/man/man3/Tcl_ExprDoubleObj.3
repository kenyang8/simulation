last critical
	component to make advanced OO systems workable as simple loadable
	extensions. TOIPC is now in the internal stub table.
	(MakeProcError, MakeLambdaError): Refactored ProcessProcResultCode to
	be simpler, some of which goes to TclObjInterpProcCore, and the rest
	of which is now in these far simpler routines which just do errorInfo
	stack generation for different types of procedure-like entity.
	* tests/apply.test (apply-5.1): Updated to expect the more informative
	form of message.

2006-10-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (HasLocalVars): New macro to make various bits and
	pieces cleaner.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclSetNsPath): Expose SetNsPath() through
	internal stubs table with semi-external name.

	* generic/tclInt.h (CallFrame): Add a field for handling context data
	for extensions (like object systems) that should be tied to a call
	frame (and not a command or interpreter).

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): Change to take CONST args;
	they were only ever used in a constant way anyway, so this appears to
	be a spot that was missed during TIP#27 work.

2006-10-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (SetLambdaFromAny): minor change, eliminate
	redundant call to Tcl_GetString (thanks aku).

	* generic/tclInterp.c (ApplyObjCmd):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (EnsembleImplementationCmd): replaced ckalloc
	(heap) with TclStackAlloc (execution stack).

2006-10-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/info.test (info-9.11-12): tests for [Bug 1577492]
	* tests/apply.test (apply-4.3-5): tests for [Bug 1574835]

	* generic/tclProc.c (ObjInterpProcEx): disable itcl hacks for calls
	from ApplyObjCmd (islambda==1), as they mess apply's error messages
	[Bug 1583266]

2006-10-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (ApplyObjCmd): fix wrong#args for apply by using
	the ensemble rewrite engine. [Bug 1574835]
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): previous commit missed usage of
	TCL_EVAL_NOREWRITE for aliases.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal): removed redundant check
	for ensembles. [Bug 1577628]

	* library/clock.tcl (format, scan): corrected wrong # args messages to
	* tests/clock.test (3.1, 34.1):	    make use of the new rewrite
	capabilities of [info level]

	* generic/tcl.h:	   Lets TEOV update the iPtr->callObj[cv] new
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   fields, except when the flag bit
	* generic/tclInt.h:	   TCL_EVAL_NOREWRITE is present. These values
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	   are used by Tcl_PushCallFrame to initialise
	* generic/tclProc.c:	   the frame's obj[cv] fields, and allows
	* tests/namespace.test:	   [info level] to know and use ensemble
	rewrites. [Bug 1577492]

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	The return value from [info level 0] on interp alias calls is changed:
	previously returned the target command (including curried values), now
	returns the source - what was actually called.

2006-10-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	   Modified the Tcl call stack so there is
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   always a valid CallFrame, even at level 0
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	   [Patch 1577278]. Most of the changes
	* generic/tclInt.h:	   involve removing tests for a NULL
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	   iPtr->(var)framePtr. There is now a
	* generic/tclObj.c:	   CallFrame pushed at interp creation with a
	* generic/tclProc.c:	   pointer to it stored in iPtr->rootFramePtr.
	* generic/tclTrace.c:	   A second unused field in Interp is
	* generic/tclVar.c:	   hijacked to enable further functionality,
	currently unused (but with several FRQs depending on it).

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Any user that includes tclInt.h and needs to determine if it is
	running at level 0 should change (iPtr->varFramePtr == NULL) to
	(iPtr->varFramePtr == iPtr->rootFramePtr).

2006-10-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h, generic/tclHash.c: Tcl_FindHashEntry now calls
	Tcl_CreateHashEntry with a newPtr set to NULL: this would have caused
	a segfault previously and eliminates duplicated code. A macro has been
	added to tcl.h (only used when TCL_PRESERVE_BINARY_COMPATABALITY is
	not set - i.e., not by default).

2006-10-20  Reinhard Max  <max@tclers.tk>

	* unix/configure.in: Added autodetection for OS-supplied timezone
	* unix/Makefile.in:  files and configure switches to override the
	* unix/configure:    detected default.

2006-10-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:		8.5a5 release date set

	* doc/Ensemble.3:	Contents) exposed by `make checkdoc`
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* doc/GetTime.3:
	* doc/PkgRequire.3:

2006-10-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (ApplyObjCmd): fixed bad error in 2006-10-12
	commit: interp released too early. Spotted by mistachkin.

2006-10-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tclProc.c (SetLambdaFromAny):
	* tests/apply.test (9.1-9.2): plugged intrep leak [Bug 1578454],
	found by mjanssen.

2006-10-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Moved TIP#219 cleanup to DeleteInterpProc.

2006-10-16  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: updates for 8.5a5 release.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpThreadGetStackSize): Darwin: fix for main
	thread, where pthread_get_stacksize_np() returns incorrect info.

	* macosx/GNUmakefile: don't redo prebinding of non-prebound binaires.

2006-10-16  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPkg.c (ExactRequirement):	Plugged memory leak. Also
	changed Tcl_Alloc()/Tcl_Free() calls to ckalloc()/ckfree() for easier
	memory debugging in the future. [Bug 1568373]

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Revise tcltest bump to 2.3a1.
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: This permits more features to be
	* unix/Makefile.in:	added to tcltest before we reach version 2.3.0
	* win/Makefile.in:	best timed to match the release of Tcl 8.5.0.
	* win/makefile.vc:	This also serves as a demo of TIP 268 features

2006-10-13  Colin McCormack <coldstore@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: corrected erroneous attempt to protect against
	NULL return from Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath per [Bug 1548263] causing
	[Bug 1575837].
	* win/tclWinFile.c: alfredd supplied patch to fix [Bug 1575837]

2006-10-13  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpThreadGetStackSize): on Darwin, use
	* unix/tcl.m4: pthread_get_stacksize_np() API to get thread stack size
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: autoheader-2.59

2006-10-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (ApplyObjCmd):
	* tests/interp.test (interp-14.5-10): made [interp alias] use the
	ensemble rewrite machinery to produce better error messages [Bug
	1576006]

2006-10-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/nmakehlp.c: Replaced all wnsprintf() calls with snprintf().
	wnsprintf was not in my shwlapi header file (VC++6)

2006-10-11  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PackageRequireEx):	Corrected crash when
	argument version=NULL passed in.

2006-10-10  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:	Updates for 8.5a5 release.

	* generic/tclNamespace.c (TclTeardownNamespace):  After the
	commandPathSourceList of a namespace is cleared, set the
	commandPathSourceList to NULL so we don't try to walk the list a
	second time, possibly after it is freed. [Bug 1566526]
	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-51.16):	Added test.

2006-10-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/UpVar.3: brough the docs in accordance to the code. Ever since
	8.0, Tcl_UpVar(2)? accepts TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY as a flag value, and
	var-3.4 tests for proper behaviour. The docs only allowed 0 and
	TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY. [Bug 1574099]

2006-10-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/*.test: updated all tests to refer explicitly to the global
	variables ::errorInfo, ::errorCode, ::env and ::tcl_platform: many
	were relying on the alternative lookup in the global namespace, that
	feature is tested specifically in namespace and variable tests.

	The modified testfiles are: apply.test, basic.test, case.test,
	cmdIL.test, cmdMZ.test, compExpr-old.test, error.test, eval.test,
	event.test, expr.test, fileSystem.test, for.test, http.test, if.test,
	incr-old.test, incr.test, interp.test, io.test, ioCmd.test, load.test,
	misc.test, namespace.test, parse.test, parseOld.test, pkg.test,
	proc-old.test, set.test, switch.test, tcltest.test, thread.test,
	var.test, while-old.test, while.test.

	* doc/binary.n:	       TIP #275: Support unsigned values in binary
	* generic/tclBinary.c: command. Tests and documentation updated.
	* tests/binary.test:

2006-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>
