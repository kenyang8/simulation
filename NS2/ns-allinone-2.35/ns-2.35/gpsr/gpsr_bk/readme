GPSR code for NS2 version 2.26 or later
Note: this implementation of GPSR is different from its original 
      version wich implemented by Brad Karp, Harvard Univ. 1999
      It is not guaranteed precise implementation of the GPSR design

Files:
1. To create a directory called "gpsr" in ns2/ns-2.2x/, put all the 
  below files in it.
gpsr_packet.h : definition of packets of different type used by this 
	implementaion
gpsr_neighbor.h : definition of the neighbor list of each node used by 
	this gpsr implementation
	including the planaring procedure (both GG and RNG)
gpsr_neighbor.cc : the implementation of the neighbor list class
gpsr.h : the definition of functions of GPSR routing agent of this 
	implementation
gpsr.cc : the implementation of the GPSR routing agent
gpsr_sinklist.h: definition used for scenarios with multiple sinks 
gpsr_sinklist.cc: implementation of gpsr_sinklist.cc
gpsr.tcl : the node and agent creation functions used by simultion 
	configuration in wireless-gpsr.tcl
wireless-gpsr.tcl : the simulation configuration 
grid-deploy10x10.tcl : 100 nodes in a 200x200 meter area 
cbr100.tcl : node 99 sends cbr traffic on UDP to node 0


2. The below files should replace the original files of ns2
packet.h : file in ns2/common 
  Or you just need to add one more packet type as "PT_GPSR"
cmu-trace.cc : file in ns2/trace
  Or you just need to tell the trace "PT_GPSR" is recognized
priqueue.cc : file in ns2/queue
  Or you just need to tell the queue "PT_GPSR" should be enqueued
    through enquenHighpriority the same as PT_DSR, PT_DSDV, etc.
ns-packet.tcl : file in ns2/tcl/lib, 
  be careful for this file, you just need to add one more entry in the 
    foreach prot {} function : GPSR. You don't really need this file to 
    be replaced if you use another version of ns2 than ns2.26

3. In the Makefile, you need to replace line 
  $(OBJ_STL)
  in ns2/ns-2.2x/Makefile as 
  $(OBJ_STL) \
  gpsr/gpsr_neighbor.o \
  gpsr/gpsr_sinklist.o \  
  gpsr/gpsr.o 


Notice: 
1) check the wireless-gpsr.tcl first and you need to configure:
   ns2home -- the home directory of your ns2 code directory
   opt(nn) -- number of nodes
   opt(start) -- the time your data source starts to publish data
   opt(stop) -- the time your data source stops to publish data

   Agent/GPSR 
	planar_type_ -- used for different planarizing algorithm
			0 for RNG planarize
			1 for GG planarize
	hello_period_ -- the period used for hello message periodically

2) after you change or replace all above files in ns2 original ones, please 
make sure you delete the packet.o file in common directory, and then 
make the ns2 again (in ns2/ns-2.2x, type make)

For more possibilities for simulation, check the wireless-gpsr.tcl file 
and the GPSR routing agent implementation code
